This Lua-script has to be put into the "~/AppData/Roaming/Aseprite/scripts" path, so Aseprite can see it.
In Aseprite you have to select a layer and then execute the script under File-> Scripts-> exportIntoText.
If you can't see the script you might have to rescan the scripts folder under File->Scripts->Rescan Scripts Folder.
